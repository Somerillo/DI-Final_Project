### **Project Title:**  
**"Time Series Analysis of Pennsylvania and Illinois Weather, Energy Consumption, and Flu Contagion (2013–2015)"**

---

### **Objective:**  
To identify and explore temporal patterns, correlations, and potential causal relationships between weather conditions, energy consumption, and flu contagion across the United States during 2013–2015.

---

### **Key Datasets:**  
1. **USA Weather Dataset (2013–2015):**  
   - Temporal granularity: Daily/hourly  
   - Variables of interest: Temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind speed, etc.  

2. **PJM Historic Energy Consumption:**  
   - Temporal granularity: Hourly  
   - Scope: Energy usage data for Pennsylvania and Illinois.  
   - Key providers: Pennsylvania (Duquesne Light), Illinois (ComEd).  

3. **Flu Contagion Dataset by State (2013–2015):**  
   - Temporal granularity: Weekly  
   - Variables: Influenza-like illness (ILI) cases, state-level aggregation.

### **Tools and Technologies:**  
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook):** Primary analysis tool for cleaning, preprocessing, statistical modeling, and visualization.  
- **Tableau:** For interactive and detailed data visualizations and dashboards.  
- **SQL (optional):** Only if large datasets require querying for efficient extraction and joining.

### **Project Structure:**  
#### **1. Data Ingestion and Preparation**  
- **Goal:** Load, clean, and integrate datasets.  
- **Subtasks:**  
  - Import datasets in CSV/Excel/JSON formats into the environment.  
  - Handle missing or inconsistent data.  
  - Transform datasets to ensure compatible temporal granularity (e.g., align daily weather data with weekly flu data).  
  - Create new calculated fields if necessary (e.g., moving averages, lagged variables).  
  - Label datasets for clarity (e.g., state codes, time zones).  

#### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Goal:** Understand the datasets and derive preliminary insights.  
- **Subtasks:**  
  - Univariate analysis for each dataset: trends, seasonality, anomalies.  
  - Bivariate and multivariate analysis to explore relationships (e.g., temperature vs. energy consumption, flu cases vs. weather).  
  - Create initial visualizations in Python (e.g., line plots, scatterplots, heatmaps).  

#### **3. Time Series Analysis**  
- **Goal:** Model temporal patterns and assess interdependencies.  
- **Subtasks:**  
  - Analyze seasonality, trends, and residuals for each dataset.  
  - Conduct correlation analysis across datasets (e.g., energy consumption vs. temperature).  
  - Perform time-series decomposition (additive/multiplicative).  
  - Apply modeling techniques:  
    - **Univariate Models:** ARIMA, SARIMA for each dataset.  
    - **Multivariate Models:** VAR, Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), or machine learning approaches (e.g., LSTM, XGBoost for time series).  

#### **4. Data Visualization and Dashboarding**  
- **Goal:** Communicate findings effectively through visuals.  
- **Subtasks:**  
  - Create comparative time series plots for weather, energy, and flu contagion trends.  
  - Develop Tableau dashboards for state-wise insights and temporal comparisons.  
  - Include interaction filters for variables like time, state, and data type.  

#### **5. Insights and Reporting**  
- **Goal:** Summarize key findings and implications.  
- **Subtasks:**  
  - Highlight significant correlations, anomalies, or causal patterns.  
  - Discuss how weather impacts energy use and flu spread.  
  - Propose actionable insights for stakeholders (e.g., health departments, energy providers).  

#### **6. Project Documentation**  
- **Goal:** Ensure reproducibility and clarity of the analysis process.  
- **Subtasks:**  
  - Document all code, assumptions, and methodologies in Jupyter Notebook.  
  - Write a README file summarizing project objectives, datasets, and key findings.  

---

### **Data Integration Plan:**  
- **Common Time Frame:** Align all datasets to the overlapping period (2013–2015).  
- **State-Level Integration:** Map flu data and energy data to the corresponding states, ensuring consistency with weather data.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Create derived metrics such as temperature anomalies, flu contagion rates, or energy usage per capita.

### **Next Steps:**  
1. Perform data ingestion and preparation to assess data quality and alignment.  
2. Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify trends and relationships.  
3. Begin implementing time series modeling for individual datasets and combined analyses.  
4. Iterate with visualization and dashboard development in Tableau.
